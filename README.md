# Parking Lot Management System
### CSE2006- Microprocessor and Interfacing Project 

---

#### Purpose
The following are the objectives of this project:
1. To create a fully automated parking lot system that optimizes parking spaces and makes the process efficient.​
2. To give real-time parking information such as vehicle parking, pay-and-park options, easy payments, reports, and a host of other features.​
3. To develop a fully working parking system that would satisfy the customer’s needs and provide them with a comfortable experience.​

The price to be paid is also automated. It is obtained by calculating the number of hours multiplied by the price of each automobile type. The number of hours would be calculated from the token that a customer takes while coming into the parking lot.

#### Result and Analysis
* As the  project aims to system for efficiently managing the records of the incoming and outgoing vehicles in the parking lot, we have designed a convenient and easy to use interface for entering the information. The user is given the option to choose from the main menu to track the entry and exit of the vehicles, display the records of the vehicles already present in the parking lot or exit.

* If the user wishes to record the entry of a vehicle, they are asked to enter the vehicle number. After entering a valid vehicle number, the system displays a vehicle parked message.

* We have set the maximum value for each vehicle type as nine in the system, so once the number exceeds the given limit for a vehicle type, the user is met with a “PARKING FULL” message. 

* The user is given the option to view the records entered to maintain a listing of vehicles currently in the parking lot.

* As the system tracks the entry and exit of cars, it will be able to determine the cost of per vehicle according to their time consumption and display it to the user when the withdraw option is selected from the menu. We have specified a standard fare for each vehicle type, and the total amount is shown on the screen. The user will be requested to enter the vehicle number and confirm the vehicle type, and the vehicle is deleted from the system.
